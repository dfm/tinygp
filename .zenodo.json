  "title": "dfm/tinygp: The tiniest of Gaussian Process libraries",
  "description": "tinygp is an extremely lightweight library for building Gaussian Process (GP) models in Python, built on top of JAX. It has a nice interface, and it's pretty fast. Thanks to JAX, tinygp supports things like GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation.\n\nCheck out the docs for more info: https://tinygp.readthedocs.io"
