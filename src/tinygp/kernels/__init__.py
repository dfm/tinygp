"""
The primary model building interface in ``tinygp`` is via "kernels", which are
typically constructed as sums and products of objects defined in this
subpackage, or by subclassing :class:`Kernel` as discussed in the :ref:`kernels`
tutorial. Many of the most commonly used kernels are described in the
:ref:`stationary-kernels` section, but this section introduces some of the
fundamental building blocks.
