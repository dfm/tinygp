    "The [celerite2 package](https://celerite2.readthedocs.io) already had support for `jax`, but since it doesn't depend on any extra compiled code, the implementation here in `tinygp` might be a little easier to get up and running, and it is significantly more flexible.\n",
    "Similarly, even though it is implemented directly in `jax`, instead of highly-optimized C++ code, the `tinygp` implementation has similar performance to the `celerite2` version (see {ref}`benchmarks`).\n",
    "\n",
    "All this being said, this performance doesn't come for free.\n",
    "In particular, this solver can only be used with data with sortable inputs, and specific types of kernels.\n",
    "In practice this generally means that you'll need 1-D input data (e.g. a time series) and you'll need to build your kernel using the members of the {ref}`api-kernels-quasisep`.\n",

    "1. This implementation is new, and it hasn't yet been pushed to its limits. If you run into problems, please [open issues or pull requests](https://github.com/dfm/tinygp/issues).\n",

    "2. The computation of the general conditional model with these kernels is not (yet!) as fast as we might want, and it may be somewhat memory heavy. For very large datasets, it is sometimes sufficient to (a) just compute the conditional at the input points (by omitting the `X_test` parameter in {func}`tinygp.GaussianProcess.condition`), (b) only compute the mean prediction, which should be fast, or (c) only predict at a few test points.\n",

    "4. It should be possible to implement more flexible models using this interface than those supported by `celerite` or `celerite2`, so stay tuned for more tutorials!"
