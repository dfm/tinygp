    "Some things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you're new to `jax` the way that I'm mixing `np` and `jnp` (the `jax` version of `numpy`) might seem a little confusing. In this example, I'm using regular `numpy` to simulate and prepare our test dataset, and then using `jax.numpy` everywhere else. The important point is that within the `neg_log_likelihood` function (and all the functions it calls), `np` is never used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This pattern of writing a `build_gp` function is a pretty common workflow in these docs. It's useful to have a way of instantiating our GP model at a new set of parameters, as we'll see below when we plot the conditional model. This might seem a little strange if you're coming from other libraries (like `george`, for example), but if you `jit` the function (see below) each model evaluation won't actually instantiate all these classes so you don't need to worry about performance implications. Check out {ref}`modeling` for some alternative workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make sure that you remember to wrap your function in `jax.jit`. [The `jax` docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io) have more details about how this works, but for our purposes, the key thing is that this allows us to use the expressive `tinygp` kernel building syntax without worrying about the performance costs of all of these allocations.\n",
