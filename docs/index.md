# tinygp

**The tiniest of Gaussian Process libraries.**

`tinygp` is an extremely lightweight library for building Gaussian Process (GP)
models in Python, built on top of [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax). It is
not (yet?) designed to provide all the shiniest algorithms for scalable
computations (check out [celerite2](https://celerite2.readthedocs.io) or
[GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai) if you need something like that), but I think it
has a [nice interface](api-ref), and it's pretty fast. Thanks to `jax`, `tinygp`
supports things like GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation.

🖥 A good place to get started is with the {ref}`install` and then the
{ref}`tutorials`. You might also be interested in the {ref}`motivation` page.

📖 For all the details, check out the {ref}`guide`, including the [full API
documentation](api-ref).

💡 If you're running into getting `tinygp` to do what you want, first check
out the {ref}`troubleshooting` page, for some general tips and tricks.

🐛 If {ref}`troubleshooting` doesn't solve your problems, or if you find bugs,
check out the {ref}`contributing` and then head on over to the [GitHub issues
page](https://github.com/dfm/tinygp/issues).
